                    Run and tell all of the angels This could take all night<br/>
					Think I need a devil to help me Get things right<br/>
					Hook me up a new revolution 'Cause this one is a lie<br/>
					We sat around laughing And watch the last one die<br/>
					<br/>I'm looking to the sky to save me<br/>
					Looking for a sign of life<br/>
					Looking for something help me burn out bright<br/>
					I'm looking for a complication Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying<br/>
					Make my way back home When I learn to fly (high)<br/>
					<br/>Think I'm done nursing the patience I can wait one night<br/>
					I'd give it all away If you give me one last try<br/>
					We live happily ever trapped If you just save my life<br/>
					Run and tell the angels That everything is all right<br/>
					<br/>I'm looking to the sky to save me Looking for a sign of life<br/>
					Looking for something help me burn out bright<br/>
					I'm looking for a complication Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying <br/>
					Make my way back home When I learn to fly (high)<br/>
					Make my way back home When I learn to fly (high)<br/>
					<br/>Fly along with me I can't quite make it alone<br/>
					Try to make this life my own<br/>
					Fly along with me I can't quite make it alone<br/>
					Try to make this life my own<br/>
					<br/>I'm looking to the sky to save me Looking for a sign of life<br/>
					Looking for something help me burn out bright<br/>
					I'm looking for a complication Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying<br/>
					Make my way back home When I learn to fly (high)<br/>
