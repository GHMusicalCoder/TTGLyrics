                    Just a small town girl, Livin' in a lonely world<br/>
					She took the midnight train, Goin' anywhere<br/>
					Just a city boy, Born and raised in South Detroit<br/>
					He took the midnight train Goin' anywhere<br/>
					<br/>A singer in a smokey room The smell of wine and cheap perfume<br/>
					For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on, and on, and on<br/>
					<br/>Strangers waiting Up and down the boulevard<br/>
					Their shadows searching In the night<br/>
					Streetlight people Livin' just to find emotion<br/>
					Hidin' somewhere in the night<br/>
					<br/>Workin' hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill<br/>
					Payin' anything to roll the dice Just one more time<br/>
					Some will win Some will lose Some were born to sing the blues<br/>
					Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on, and on, and on<br/>
					<br/>Strangers waiting Up and down the boulevard<br/>
					Their shadows searching In the night<br/>
					Streetlight people Livin' just to find emotion<br/>
					Hidin' somewhere in the night<br/>
					<br/>Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin'<br/>
					Streetlight people<br/>
					Don't stop believin' Hold on Streetlight people<br/>
					Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin'<br/>
					Streetlight people<br/>
