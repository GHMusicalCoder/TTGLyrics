                    <hr>
                    Nibblin' on sponge cake, Watchin' the sun bake<br/>
                    All of those tourists covered with oil.<br/>
                    Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing.<br/>
                    Smell those shrimp They're beginnin' to boil.<br/>
                    <br/>Wasted away again in Margaritaville,<br/>
                    Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.<br/>
                    Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,<br/>
                    But I know it's nobody's fault.<br/>
                    <br/>Don't know the reason, Stayed here all season<br/>
                    With nothing to show but this brand new tattoo.<br/>
                    But it's a real beauty, A Mexican cutie,<br/>
                    how it got here I haven't a clue.<br/>
                    <br/>Wasted away again in Margaritaville,<br/>
                    Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.<br/>
                    Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,<br/>
                    Now I think, - hell it could be my fault.<br/>
                    <br/>I blew out my flip flop, Stepped on a pop top;<br/>
                    Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home.<br/>
                    But there's booze in the blender, And soon it will render<br/>
                    That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.<br/>
                    <br/>Wasted away again in Margaritaville<br/>
                    Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.<br/>
                    Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,<br/>
                    But I know, it's my own damn fault.<br/>
                    <br/>Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame,<br/>
                    And I know it's my own damn fault
