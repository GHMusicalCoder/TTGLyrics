                    Jessie is a friend, Yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine<br/>
                    But lately something's changed It ain't hard to define<br/>
                    Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine<br/>
                    <br/>And she's watching him with those eyes<br/>
                    And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!<br/>
                    And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night<br/>
                    <br/>You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    Where can I find a woman like that?<br/>
                    <br/>I play along with the charade That doesn't seem to be a reason to change<br/>
                    You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute<br/>
                    I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot<br/>
                    <br/>'Cause she's watching him with those eyes<br/>
                    And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!<br/>
                    And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night<br/>
                    <br/>You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    Where can I find a woman like that?<br/>
                    Like Jessie's girl I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    Where can I find a woman... Where can I find a woman like that?<br/>
                    <br/>And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time<br/>
                    Wonderin' what she don't see in me<br/>
                    I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines<br/>
                    Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?<br/>
                    <br/>Tell me, why can't I find a woman like that?<br/>
                    <br/>You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    I wish that I had Jessie's girl I want Jessie's girl<br/>
                    Where can I find a woman like that?<br/>
                    <br/>Like Jessie's girl I wish that I had Jessie's girl<br/>
                    I want, I want Jessie's girl<br/>
