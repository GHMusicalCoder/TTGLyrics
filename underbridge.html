                    Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner<br/>
					Sometimes I feel like my only friend<br/>
					Is the city I live in, the city of angels<br/>
					Lonely as I am, together we cry<br/>
					<br/>I drive on her streets cause she's my companion<br/>
					I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am<br/>
					She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy<br/>
					Well, I never worry, now that is a lie<br/>
					<br/>I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day<br/>
					But take me to the place I love, take me all the way<br/>
					I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day<br/>
					But take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
					<br/>It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there<br/>
					It's hard to believe that I'm all alone<br/>
					At least I have her love, the city, she loves me<br/>
					Lonely as I am, together we cry<br/>
					<br/>I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day<br/>
					But take me to the place I love, take me all the way<br/>
					I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day<br/>
					But take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
					Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah<br/>
					Love me, I say, yeah yeah One time<br/>
					<br/>Under the bridge downtown Is where I drew some blood<br/>
					Under the bridge downtown I could not get enough<br/>
					Under the bridge downtown Forgot about my love<br/>
					Under the bridge downtown I gave my life away Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
					Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah<br/>
					Please don't I said yeah yeah<br/>
					Where I stay
