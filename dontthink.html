					Hold it right there Don't say a word<br/>
					I hear a voice I've never heard<br/>
					Calling my name Saying this is the one<br/>
					Oh my goodness what have you done<br/>
					I could turn around and walk away<br/>
					Saying this is too good to be real<br/>
					But oh no I don't think I will<br/>
					<br/>Because I absolutely, positively know without a doubt<br/>
					You're becoming someone I just could not live without<br/>
					I was so afraid I'd spend my whole life not knowing how this feels<br/>
					Oh no, I don't think I will<br/>
					<br/>I could just do what I've done before<br/>
					Blame it all on the moon Say it's nothing more<br/>
					Than the pull of the tide And it's gonna pass<br/>
					But something's telling me This time it's gonna last<br/>
					I could close my eyes and just pretend I don't feel the way I feel<br/>
					But oh no, I don't think I will<br/>
					<br/>Because I absolutely, positively know without a doubt<br/>
					You're becoming someone I just could not live without<br/>
					I was so afraid I'd spend my whole life not knowing how this feels<br/>
					Oh no, I don't think I will<br/>
					<br/>Oh no I don't think<br/>
					Oh ya I don't think I<br/>
					Oh no I don't think I will
