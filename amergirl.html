                    Well she was an american girl<br/>
                    raised on promises<br/>
                    she couldn't help thinking that there<br/>
                    was a little more life<br/>
                    somewhere else<br/>
                    After all it was a great big world<br/>
                    With lots of places to run to<br/>
                    Yeah and if she had to die<br/>
                    Tryin' she<br/>
                    Had one little promise she was gonna keep<br/>
                    <br/>Oh Yeah, All right<br/>
                    Take it easy, baby<br/>
                    Make it last all night<br/>
                    She was an american girl<br/>
                    <br/>It was kinda cold that night<br/>
                    She stood alone on her balcony<br/>
                    She could hear the cars roll by<br/>
                    Out on 441, like waves crashin' on the beach<br/>
                    And for one desperate moment there<br/>
                    He crept back in her memory<br/>
                    God its so painful how something that's so close<br/>
                    Is still so far out of reach<br/>
                    <br/>Oh Yeah, All right<br/>
                    Take it easy, baby<br/>
                    Make it last all night<br/>
                    She was an american girl<br/>
