                    How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable<br/>
					So condescending unnecessarily critical<br/>
					I have the tendency of getting very physical<br/>
					So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle<br/>
					You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here<br/>
					The double vision I was seeing is finally clear<br/>
					You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone<br/>
					Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on<br/>
					<br/>When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<br/>
					You'll understand what I mean when I say<br/>
					There's no way we're gonna give up<br/>
					And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					<br/>What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head<br/>
					You should know better you never listened to a word I said<br/>
					Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat<br/>
					Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did<br/>
					<br/>When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<br/>
					You'll understand what I mean when I say<br/>
					There's no way we're gonna give up<br/>
					And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					Does it kill Does it burn Is it painful to learn<br/>
					That it's me that has all the control<br/>
					Does it thrill Does it sting When you feel what I bring<br/>
					And you wish that you had me to hold<br/>
					<br/>When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<br/>
					You'll understand what I mean when I say<br/>
					There's no way we're gonna give up<br/>
					And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe<br/>
					Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
