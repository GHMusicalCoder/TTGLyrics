					love I get so lost, sometimes<br/>
                    days pass and this emptiness fills my heart<br/>
                    when I want to run away I drive off in my car<br/>
                    but whichever way I go I come back to the place you are<br/>
                    <br/>all my instincts, they return<br/>
                    and the grand facade, so soon will burn<br/>
                    without a noise, without my pride<br/>
                    I reach out from the inside<br/>
                    <br/>in your eyes the light the heat<br/>
                    in your eyes I am complete<br/>
                    in your eyes I see the doorway to a thousand churches<br/>
                    in your eyes the resolution of all the fruitless searches<br/>
                    in your eyes I see the light and the heat<br/>
                    in your eyes oh, I want to be that complete<br/>
                    I want to touch the light the heat I see in your eyes<br/>
                    <br/>love, I don't like to see so much pain<br/>
                    so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away<br/>
                    I get so tired of working so hard for our survival<br/>
                    I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive<br/>
                    <br/>and all my instincts, they return<br/>
                    and the grand facade, so soon will burn<br/>
                    without a noise, without my pride<br/>
                    I reach out from the inside<br/>
                    <br/>in your eyes the light the heat<br/>
                    in your eyes I am complete<br/>
                    in your eyes I see the doorway to a thousand churches<br/>
                    in your eyes the resolution of all the fruitless searches<br/>
                    in your eyes I see the light and the heat<br/>
                    in your eyes oh, I want to be that complete<br/>
                    I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes<br/>
                    in your eyes in your eyes<br/>
                    in your eyes in your eyes<br/>
                    in your eyes in your eyes
