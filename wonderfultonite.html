                    <hr>
					It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear<br/>
					She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.<br/>
					And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"<br/>
					And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."<br/>
					<br/>We go to a party and everyone turns to see<br/>
					This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.<br/>
					And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"<br/>
					And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."<br/>
					<br/>I feel wonderful because I see The love light in your eyes.<br/>
					And the wonder of it all Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.<br/>
					<br/>It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,<br/>
					So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.<br/>
					And then I tell her, as I turn out the light,<br/>
					I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight.<br/>
					<br/>Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."
