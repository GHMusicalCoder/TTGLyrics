                    Well I guess it would be nice If I could touch your body<br/>
                    I know not everybody Has got a body like you<br/>
                    But I've got to think twice Before I give my heart away<br/>
                    And I know all the games you play Because I play them too<br/>
                    <br/>Oh but I Need some time off from that emotion<br/>
                    Time to pick my heart up off the floor<br/>
                    Oh when that love comes down Without devotion<br/>
                    Well it takes a strong man baby But I'm showing you the door<br/>
                    <br/>‘Cause I gotta have faith I gotta have faith<br/>
                    ‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith<br/>
                    ‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith<br/>
                    <br/>Baby, I know you're asking me to stay<br/>
                    Say please, please, please don't go away<br/>
                    You say I'm giving you the blues<br/>
                    Maybe You mean every word you say<br/>
                    Can't help but think of yesterday<br/>
                    And another who tied me down to loverboy rules<br/>
                    Before this river Becomes an ocean<br/>
                    Before you throw my heart back on the floor<br/>
                    Oh oh baby I reconsider My foolish notion<br/>
                    Well I need someone to hold me<br/>
                    But I'll wait for something more<br/>
                    <br/>Yes I've gotta have faith… Mmm, I gotta have faith<br/>
                    ‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith<br/>
                    I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith<br/>
                    <br/>Before this river Becomes an ocean<br/>
                    Before you throw my heart back on the floor<br/>
                    Oh oh baby I reconsider My foolish notion<br/>
                    Well I need someone to hold me<br/>
                    But I'll wait for something more<br/>
                    <br/>Yes I've gotta have faith… Mmm, I gotta have faith<br/>
                    ‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith<br/>
                    I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith<br/>
