                    What day is it? And in what month? This clock never seemed so alive<br/>
					I can't keep up and I can't back down I've been losing so much time<br/>
					<br/>'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose<br/>
					And it's you and me and all of the people<br/>
					And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you<br/>
					<br/>All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right<br/>
					I'm tripping on words You got my head spinning I don't know where to go from here<br/>
					<br/>'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to prove<br/>
					And it's you and me and all of the people<br/> 
					And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you<br/>
					<br/>Something about you now I can't quite figure out<br/>
					Everything she does is beautiful Everything she does is right<br/>
					<br/>'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose<br/>
					And it's you and me and all of the people<br/>
					And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you<br/>
					And me and all of the people with nothing to do and nothing to prove<br/>
					And it's you and me and all of the people<br/>
					And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you<br/>
					<br/>What day is it? And in what month? This clock never seemed so alive
