					When you close your eyes and you go to sleep<br/>
                    And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat<br/>
                    I can hear the things that you're dreaming about<br/>
                    When you open up your heart and the truth comes out<br/>
                    <br/>You tell me that you want me You tell me that you need me<br/>
                    You tell me that you love me And I know that I'm right<br/>
                    'Cause I hear it in the night<br/>
                    <br/>I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    <br/>When I hold you in my arms at night <br/>
                    Don't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight<br/>
                    And all your dreams that you keep inside<br/>
                    You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide<br/>
                    <br/>You tell me that you want me You tell me that you need me<br/>
                    You tell me that you love me And I know that I'm right <br/>
                    'Cause I hear it in the night<br/>
                    <br/>I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    <br/>When you close your eyes and you fall asleep <br/>
                    Everything about you is a mystery<br/>
                    <br/>You tell me that you want me You tell me that you need me<br/>
                    You tell me that you love me And I know that I'm right<br/>
                    'Cause I hear it in the night<br/>
                    <br/>I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
                    I hear the secrets that you keep
