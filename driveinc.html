					Sometimes I feel the fear of <br/>
                    uncertainty stinging clear<br/>
                    And I can't help but ask myself how much <br/>
                    I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer<br/>
                    <br/>It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague<br/>
                    Haunting mass appeal<br/>
                    Lately I'm beginning to find that I <br/>
                    should be the one behind the wheel<br/>
                    <br/>Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there<br/>
                    With open arms and open eyes, yeah<br/>
                    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there<br/>
                    <br/>So if I decide to waiver my <br/>
                    chance to be one of the hive<br/>
                    Will I choose water over wine and<br/>
                    hold my own and drive, oh oh<br/>
                    <br/>It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way<br/>
                    That everyone else gets around<br/>
                    Lately, I'm beginning to find that when I <br/>
                    drive myself, my light is found<br/>
                    <br/>Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there<br/>
                    With open arms and open eyes, yeah<br/>
                    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there<br/>
                    <br/>Would you choose water over wine... <br/>
                    hold the wheel and drive?<br/>
                    <br/>Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there<br/>
                    With open arms and open eyes, yeah<br/>
                    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there
