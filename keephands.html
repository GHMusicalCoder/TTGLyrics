                    I got a little change in my pocket goin' jing-a-ling-a-ling<br/>
					Wants to call you on the telephone baby, a-give you a ring<br/>
					But each time we talk, I get the same old thing<br/>
					Always no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' ring<br/>
					My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br/>
					She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself<br/>
					<br/>B-B-B-baby baby baby why you wan' treat me this way<br/>
					You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way<br/>
					That's when she told me a story, 'bout free milk and a cow<br/>
					And said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' vow<br/>
					My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br/>
					She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself<br/>
					<br/>Hold it here<br/>
					<br/>See I wanted her real bad, and I was about to give in<br/>
					But that's when she started talking about true love,<br/>
					Started talking about sin<br/>
					And I said, honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life,<br/>
					She said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until you make me your wife-a<br/>
					My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf<br/>
					She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
