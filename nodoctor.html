                    I don't need no doctor 'Cause I know what's ailing me<br/>
					I don't need no doctor 'Cause I know what's ailing me<br/>
					All I need is my baby, she keeps me away from misery<br/>
					<br/>I don't need no doctor For my prescription to be filled<br/>
					I don't need no doctor For my prescription to be filled, yeah<br/>
					All I need is my baby, she keep away the chill<br/>
					<br/>Now the doctor say I need rest He put me on the critical list<br/>
					To keep me away from harm, all I need is her sweet charm<br/>
					He gave me a medicated lotion, it wouldn't soothe my emotion<br/>
					I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor<br/>
					I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor<br/>
