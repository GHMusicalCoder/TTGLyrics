                    I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug<br/>
                    With a girl named Linda Lu<br/>
                    When in walked a man with a gun in his hand<br/>
                    And he was looking for you know who.<br/>
                    He said, "Hey there fellow, With the hair colored yellow,<br/>
                    What you tryin' to prove?<br/>
                    'Cause that's my woman there And I'm a man who cares<br/>
                    And this might be all for you."<br/>
                    <br/>I said, "Excuse me."<br/>
                    <br/>I was scared and fearing for my life.<br/>
                    I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree.<br/>
                    'Cause he was lean, mean, Big and bad, Lord,<br/>
                    Pointin' that gun at me.<br/>
                    Oh "Wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her.<br/>
                    Don't want no trouble with you.<br/>
                    And I know you don't owe me But I wish you'd let me<br/>
                    Ask one favor from you."<br/>
                    <br/>"Oh, won't you give me three steps, Gimme three steps a-mister,<br/>
                    Gimme three steps towards the door?<br/>
                    Gimme three steps Gimme three steps a-mister,<br/>
                    And you'll never see a-me no more For sure."<br/>
                    <br/>Well the crowd cleared away And I began to pray<br/>
                    And the water fell on the floor.<br/>
                    And I'm telling you son, Well, it ain't no fun<br/>
                    Staring straight down a forty-four.<br/>
                    Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lu<br/>
                    And that's the break I was looking for.<br/>
                    And you could hear me screaming a mile away<br/>
                    As I was headed out towards the door.<br/>
                    <br/>"Oh, won't you give me three steps, Gimme three steps a-mister,<br/>
                    Gimme three steps towards the door?<br/>
                    Gimme three steps Gimme three steps a-mister,<br/>
                    And you'll never see a-me no more."<br/>
                    <br/>Show me the back door.
