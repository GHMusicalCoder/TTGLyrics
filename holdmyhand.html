                    With a little love, and some tenderness<br/>
                    We'll walk upon the water, We'll rise above this mess<br/>
                    With a little peace, and some harmony<br/>
                    We'll take the world together, We'll take 'em by the hand<br/>
                    <br/>'Cause I've got a hand for you, 'Cause I wanna run with you<br/>
                    <br/>Yesterday, I saw you standing there,<br/>
                    Your head was down, your eyes were red, No comb had touched your hair<br/>
                    I said get up, and let me see you smile<br/>
                    We'll take a walk together, Walk the road awhile, 'cause<br/>
                    <br/>'Cause I've got a hand for you, I've got a hand for you<br/>
                    'Cause I wanna run with you, Won't you let me run with you? yeah<br/>
                    <br/>Hold my hand, Want you to hold my hand<br/>
                    Hold my hand, I'll take you to a place where you can be<br/>
                    Hold my hand, Anything you wanna be because<br/>
                    I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can<br/>
                    <br/>See I was wasted, and I was wasting time<br/>
                    'Till I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes<br/>
                    Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud<br/>
                    I don't wanna be part of your problems, Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no<br/>
                    <br/>'Cause I've got a hand for you, I've got a hand for you<br/>
                    'Cause I wanna run with you, Ah, won't you let me run with you?<br/>
                    <br/>Hold my hand, Want you to hold my hand<br/>
                    Hold my hand, I'll take you to the promised land<br/>
                    Hold my hand, Maybe we can't change the world but<br/>
                    I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can, yeah<br/>
                    <br/>Hold my hand, Want you to hold my hand<br/>
                    Hold my hand, I'll take you to a place where you can be<br/>
                    Hold my hand, Anything you wanna be because<br/>
                    I...Oh...No, No, No, No, No<br/>
                    Hold my hand, Want you to hold my hand<br/>
                    Hold my hand, I'll take you to the promised land<br/>
                    Hold my hand, Maybe we can't change the world but<br/>
                    I wanna love you the best that, best that I can<br/>
                    Oh, The best that I can
