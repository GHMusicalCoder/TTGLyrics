                    I was born to run I was born to dream<br/>
					The craziest boy you ever seen<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					<br/>And I was here to please I'm even on knees<br/>
					Makin' love to whoever I please<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					<br/>And then you came around Tried to tie me down<br/>
					I was such a clown<br/>
					You had to have it your way Or no way at all<br/>
					<br/>Well I've had all I can take I can't take it no more<br/>
					I'm gonna pack my bags and fly, baby<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					<br/>So why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					Why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way I want to fly<br/>
					<br/>I'm here to please I'm even on my knees<br/>
					Makin' love to whoever I please<br/>
					I gotta do it my way I gotta do it my way<br/>
					<br/>And when you came around You tried to tie me down<br/>
					I was such a clown<br/>
					You had to have it your way Well I'm sayin' no way<br/>
					<br/>So why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					Why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way I want to fly<br/>
					<br/>So why don't you turn me loose, Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way Or no way at all<br/>
					Why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way I gotta do it my way<br/>
					<br/>Why don't you turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose<br/>
					I gotta do it my way I want to fly<br/>
					Turn me loose
