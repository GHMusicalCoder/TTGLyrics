					When I was a young boy, Said put away those young boy ways<br/>
					Now that I'm getting' older, so much older, <br/>
					I long for those young boy days<br/>
					With a girl like you, With a girl like you<br/>
					Lord knows there are things we can do, baby<br/>
					Just me and you, Come on and make it a<br/>
					<br/>Hurt so good, Come on baby make it hurt so good<br/>
					Sometimes love don't feel like it should<br/>
					You make it, hurt so good<br/>
					<br/>You don't have to be so exciting<br/>
					Just trying to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah<br/>
					You always look so inviting<br/>
					You ain't as green as you are young<br/>
					Hey baby it's you, Come on girl now it's you<br/>
					Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby<br/>
					Let's see what we can do, Come on and make it a<br/>
					<br/>Hurt so good Come on baby make it hurt so good<br/>
					Sometimes love don't feel like it should<br/>
					You make it hurt so good<br/>
					<br/>I ain't talking no big deals, I ain't made no plans myself<br/>
					I ain't talking no high heels, Maybe we could walk around, all day long,<br/>
					Walk around, all day long<br/>
					<br/>Hurt so good Come on baby make it hurt so good<br/>
					Sometimes love don't feel like it should<br/>
					You make it hurt so good<br/>
					<br/>Hurt so good, come baby now Come on baby make it hurt so good<br/>
					Sometimes love don't feel like it should<br/>
					You make it hurt so good<br/>
					<br/>Hey, hey
