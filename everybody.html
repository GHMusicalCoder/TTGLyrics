					You see 'em comin' at you every night<br/>
					Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight<br/>
					You know their business, you think it's a bore<br/>
					They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before<br/>
					<br/>Get around town, spend your time on the run<br/>
					You never let down, say you do it for fun<br/>
					Never miss a play, though you make quite a few<br/>
					You give it all away - everybody wants you<br/>
					<br/>You crave attention, you can never say "no"<br/>
					Throw your affections any way the wind blows<br/>
					You always make it, you're on top of the scene<br/>
					You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine<br/>
					Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else<br/>
					You never realize what you do to yourself<br/>
					The things that they see make the daily reviews<br/>
					You never get free - everybody wants you<br/>
					<br/>Everybody knows you Everybody snows you<br/>
					Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you<br/>
					<br/>Nights of confusion and impossible dreams<br/>
					Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams<br/>
					You got your glory, you paid for it all<br/>
					You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol<br/>
					Say goodbye to conventional ways<br/>
					You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days<br/>
					The more you understand, seems the more like you do<br/>
					You never get away - everybody wants you
