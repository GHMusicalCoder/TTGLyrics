                    My Girlfriend's a dick magnet My Girlfriend's gotta have it<br/>
					She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots<br/>
					Tip the man he'll ring the bell Get her drunk she'll scream like hell<br/>
					Dirty girl, gettin' down Dance with guys from outta town<br/>
					Grab her ass, actin' tough Mess with her she'll fuck you up<br/>
					No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned<br/>
					But she's coming back to my place tonight<br/>
					<br/>She likes to shake her ass She grinds it to the beat<br/>
					She likes to pull my hair When I make her grind her teeth<br/>
					I like to strip her down She's naughty to the end<br/>
					You know what she is, no doubt about it She's a bad, bad girlfriend<br/>
					<br/>Red thong, Party's on Love this song, sing along<br/>
					Come together, leave alone See you later back at home<br/>
					No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned<br/>
					But she's coming back to my place tonight<br/>
					I say no one really knows just how far she's gonna go<br/>
					But I'm gonna find out later tonight<br/>
					<br/>She likes to shake her ass She grinds it to the beat<br/>
					She likes to pull my hair When I make her grind her teeth<br/>
					I like to strip her down She's naughty to the end<br/>
					You know what she is, no doubt about it She's a bad, bad girlfriend<br/>
					<br/>Doesn't take her long to make things right<br/>
					But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?<br/>
					The time of her life<br/>
					My girlfriend's a dick magnet My girlfriend's gotta have it<br/>
					<br/>She's a gold digger Now you figure out it's over Pull the trigger<br/>
					Futures finished, there it went Savings gone, the money spent<br/>
					Look around and all I see No good, bad and ugly<br/>
					Man she's hot and fixed to be The future ex-Miss Connolly<br/>
					<br/>She likes to shake her ass She grinds it to the beat<br/>
					She likes to pull my hair When I make her grind her teeth<br/>
					I like to strip her down She's naughty to the end<br/>
					You know what she is, no doubt about it She's a bad, bad girlfriend<br/>
					She's a bad, bad girlfriend<br/>
					She's a bad, bad girlfriend<br/>
