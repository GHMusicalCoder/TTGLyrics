                    Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?<br/>
					My homeroom homeroom angel Always pulled me from my seat<br/>
					She was pure like snowflakes No one could ever stain<br/>
					The memory of my angel Could never cause me pain<br/>
					<br/>Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine<br/>
					And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between<br/>
					<br/>My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					My angel is the centerfold Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					<br/>Slipped me notes under the desk While I was thinkin' about her dress<br/>
					I was shy I turned away Before she caught my eye<br/>
					I was shakin' in my shoes Whenever she flashed those baby-blues<br/>
					Something had a hold on me When angel passed close by<br/>
					<br/>Those soft and fuzzy sweaters Too magical to touch<br/>
					To see her in that negligee Is really just too much<br/>
					<br/>My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					My angel is the centerfold Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					Na na na na na na na na na na na na...
					<br/>It's okay I understand This ain't no never-never land<br/>
					I hope that when this issue's gone I'll see you when your clothes are on<br/>
					Take you car, yes we will We'll take your car and drive it<br/>
					We'll take it to a motel room And take 'em off in private<br/>
					<br/>A part of me has just been ripped The pages from my mind are stripped<br/>
					Oh no, I can't deny it Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it<br/>
					<br/>My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					My angel is the centerfold Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					My Angel in the centerfold<br/>
					<br/>Alright alright... 1 2 3 4<br/>
					<br/>My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					My angel is the centerfold Angel is the centerfold<br/>
					My blood runs cold My memory has just been sold<br/>
					Angel is the centerfold
