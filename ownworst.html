                    Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?<br/>
					I didn't mean to call you that<br/>
					I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me<br/>
					Please tell me...<br/>
					<br/>Please tell me why my car is in the front yard,<br/>
					And I'm sleeping with my clothes on<br/>
					I came in through the window last night<br/>
					And you're gone, gone<br/>
					<br/>It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy<br/>
					'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me<br/>
					The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette<br/>
					Still burning,<br/>
					<br/>Please tell me why my car is in the front yard<br/>
					And I'm sleeping with my clothes on<br/>
					I came in through the window last night<br/>
					And you're gone, gone<br/>
					<br/>Please tell me why my car is in the front yard<br/>
					And I'm sleeping with my clothes on<br/>
					I came in through the window last night<br/>
					<br/>It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy<br/>
					'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me<br/>
					Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?<br/>
					I didn't mean to call you that
