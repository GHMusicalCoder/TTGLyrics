                    I've got your picture of me and you<br />
                    You wrote "I love you" I wrote "me too"<br />
                    I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do<br />
                    Oh it's in color, Your hair is brown<br />
                    Your eyes are hazel and soft as clouds<br />
                    I often kiss you when there's no one else around<br />
                    <br />I've got your picture, I've got your picture<br />
                    I'd like a million of you all round my cell<br />
                    I want a doctor to take your picture<br />
                    So I can look at you from inside as well<br />
                    You've got me turning up and turning down<br />
                    And turning in and turning 'round<br />
                    <br />I'm turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    <br />I've got your picture, I've got your picture<br />
                    I'd like a million of you all round my cell<br />
                    I want a doctor to take your picture<br />
                    So I can look at you from inside as well<br />

                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    Turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
                    <br />No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women<br />
                    No fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark<br />
                    Everyone around me is a total stranger<br />
                    Everyone avoids me like a cyclone ranger, everyone<br />
                    <br />I'm turning Japanese<br />
                    I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so<br />
