					One life I'm gonna live it up I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.<br/>
                    Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud I'm on top as long as the music's loud.<br/>
                    <br/>If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by<br/>
                    You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.<br/>
                    Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had If you think I'll let it go you're mad<br/>
                    You've got another thing comin'.<br/>
                    <br/>That's right here's where the talkin' ends <br/>
                    Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.<br/>
                    Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.<br/>
                    <br/>If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain<br/>
                    Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.<br/>
                    Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had If you think I'll let it go you're mad<br/>
                    You've got another thing comin'.<br/>
                    <br/>In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow<br/>
                    Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.<br/>
                    <br/>Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah Act tough ain't room for second best.<br/>
                    Real strong got me some security Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.<br/>
                    <br/>If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by<br/>
                    You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.<br/>
                    Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had If you think I'll let it go you're mad<br/>
                    You've got another thing comin'.<br/>
                    You've got another thing comin'.<br/>
                    You've got another thing comin'.<br/>
