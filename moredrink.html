                    He was sittin' at the bar, sippin' on a regular Coke<br/>
                    We were drinkin' and smokin' and makin' him the butt of our jokes<br/>
                    We all said, "Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?"<br/>
                    He said, "I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't."<br/>
                    <br/>Cause the more I drink, the more I drink<br/>
                    Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine<br/>
                    I get loud, I get proud....and it gets worse<br/>
                    Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen<br/>
                    Naw, there ain't no in-between<br/>
                    Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink.<br/>
                    <br/>A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot.<br/>
                    Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start lookin' hot<br/>
                    And pretty soon I'm bummin' cigarettes and sweet talkin' some big brunette<br/>
                    Yeah, once I get on a roll, ain't no tellin' where I'll stop<br/>
                    <br/>Cause the more I drink, the more I drink<br/>
                    Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine<br/>
                    I get loud, I get proud....and it gets worse<br/>
                    Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen<br/>
                    Naw, there ain't no in-between<br/>
                    Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink.<br/>
                    <br/>Yep-yep... Humm, that's what I'm talking about<br/>
                    <br/>Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen<br/>
                    And they can't get me off the kareoke machine,<br/>
                    The more I drink...the more I drink.<br/>
                    Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink.
