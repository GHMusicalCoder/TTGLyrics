                    Well, I don't know why I came here tonight<br/>
					I got the feeling that something ain't right<br/>
					I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair<br/>
					And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br/>
					Clowns 2 left / jokers 2 right Here I am, stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					<br/>Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					And I'm wondering what it is I should do<br/>
					It's so hard to keep this smile from my face<br/>
					Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place<br/>
					Clowns 2 left / jokers 2 right Here I am, stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					<br/>Well, you started off with nothing<br/>
					And you're proud that you're a self-made man<br/>
					And your friends they all come crawlin'<br/>
					Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"<br/>
					<br/>Trying to make some sense of it all<br/>
					But I can see it makes no sense at all<br/>
					Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?<br/>
					Well, I don't think I can take anymore<br/>
					Clowns 2 left / jokers 2 right Here I am, stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					<br/>Well, you started out with nothing<br/>
					And you're proud that you're a self-made man<br/>

					<br/>Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					Stuck in the middle with you<br/>
					Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
