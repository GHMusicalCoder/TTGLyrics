                    She sits alone By a lamp post<br/>
                    Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind<br/>
                    She says Dad's the one I love the most<br/>
                    But Stipe's not far behind<br/>
                    She never lets me in Only tell me where's she's been<br/>
                    When she's had too much to drink<br/>
                    I say that I don't care I just run my hands through her dark hair<br/>
                    Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away and just...<br/>
                    <br/>Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain<br/>
                    Let her sing, if it eases all her pain<br/>
                    Let her go, let her walk right out on me<br/>
                    And if the sun comes up tomorrow<br/>
                    Let her be, let her be.<br/>
                    <br/>This morning I woke up alone Found a note standin' by the phone<br/>
                    Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day<br/>
                    I wanted to look for you You walked in<br/>
                    I didn't know just what I should do<br/>
                    So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself saying...<br/>
                    <br/>Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain<br/>
                    Let her sing, if it eases all her pain<br/>
                    Let her go, let her walk right out on me<br/>
                    And if the sun comes up tomorrow<br/>
                    Let her be, let her be.<br/>
                    <br/>Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain<br/>
                    Let her sing, if it eases all her pain<br/>
                    Let her go, let her walk right out on me<br/>
                    And if the sun comes up tomorrow<br/>
                    Let her be, oh, oh.<br/>
                    <br/>Last night I tried to leave Cried so much I could not believe<br/>
                    She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago<br/>
                    She went in the back to get high I sat down on my couch and cried<br/>
                    Yelling oh mama please help me Won't you hold my hand and...<br/>
                    <br/>Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain<br/>
                    Let her sing, if it eases all her pain<br/>
                    Let her go, let her walk right out on me<br/>
                    And if the sun comes up tomorrow<br/>
                    Let her be, oh, oh.<br/>
                    Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain<br/>
                    Let her sing, if it eases all her pain<br/>
                    Let her go, let her walk right out on me<br/>
                    And if the sun comes up tomorrow<br/>
                    Let her be, oh, let her be.
