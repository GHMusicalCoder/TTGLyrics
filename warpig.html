                    Generals gathered in their masses<br/>
					just like witches at black masses<br/>
					Evil minds that plot destruction,<br/>
					sorcerer of death's construction.<br/>
					In the fields the bodies burning,<br/>
					as the war machine keeps turning.<br/>
					Death and hatred to mankind,<br/>
					poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!<br/>
					<br/>Politicians hide themselves away<br/>
					They only started the war<br/>
					Why should they go out to fight?<br/>
					They leave that role to the poor<br/>
					<br/>Time will tell on their power minds<br/>
					Making war just for fun<br/>
					Treating people just like pawns in chess<br/>
					Wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!<br/>
					<br/>Now in darkness, world stops turning,<br/>
					ashes where the bodies burning.<br/>
					No more war pigs have the power,<br/>
					hand of god has struck the hour.<br/>
					Day of judgement, god is calling,<br/>
					on their knees the war pigs crawling.<br/>
					Begging mercy for their sins,<br/>
					Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!
