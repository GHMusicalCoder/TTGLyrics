                    Well, I walk into the room Passing out hundred dollar bills<br/>
					And it kills, and it thrills, like the horns on my silverado grill<br/>
					And I buy the bar double round the crown And everybody's getting down<br/>
					An' this town, ain't never gonna be the same<br/>
					<br/>Cause I saddle up my horse And I ride into the city<br/>
					I make a lot of noise Cause the girls They are so pretty<br/>
					Riding up and down broadway On my old stud leroy<br/>
					And the girls say Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					Everybody says Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					<br/>Well I don't give a dang about nothing I'm singing and bling-blinging<br/>
					While the girls are drinking Long necks down!<br/>
					And I wouldn't trade ol' leroy Or my chevrolet for your escalade<br/>
					Or your freak parade I'm the only john wayne left in this town<br/>
					<br/>Cause I saddle up my horse And I ride into the city<br/>
					I make a lot of noise Cause the girls They are so pretty<br/>
					Riding up and down broadway On my old stud leroy<br/>
					And the girls say Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					Everybody says Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					<br/>I'm a thourough-bred That's what she said<br/>
					In the back of my truck bed As I was gettin' buzzed on suds<br/>
					Out on some back country road.<br/>
					We were flying high Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time<br/>
					And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.<br/>
					But her evaluation Of my cowboy reputation<br/>
					Had me begging for slavation All night long<br/>
					So I took her out giggin frogs Introduced her to my old bird dog<br/>
					And sang her every wilie nelson song I could think of And we made love<br/>
					<br/>Cause I saddle up my horse And I ride into the city<br/>
					I make a lot of noise Cause the girls They are so pretty<br/>
					Riding up and down broadway On my old stud leroy<br/>
					And the girls say Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					Everybody says Save a horse, ride a cowboy<br/>
					What? What? Save a horse ride a cowboy<br/>
					<br/>Everybody says Save a horse ride a cowboy
