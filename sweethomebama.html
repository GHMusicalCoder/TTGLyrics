					Big wheels keep on turning Carry me home to see my kin<br/>
					Singing songs about the Southland<br/>
					I miss Alabamy once again And I think it's a sin<br/>
					<br/>Well I heard mister Young sing about her Well, I heard ole Neil put her down<br/>
					Well, I hope Neil Young will remember A Southern man don't need him around anyhow<br/>
					<br/>Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue<br/>
					Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you<br/>
					<br/>In Birmingham they love the governor Now we all did what we could do<br/>
					Now Watergate does not bother me Does your conscience bother you?<br/>
					Tell the truth<br/>
					<br/>Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue<br/>
					Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you Here I come Alabama<br/>
					<br/>Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers<br/>
					And they've been known to pick a song or two<br/>
					Lord they get me off so much They pick me up when I'm feeling blue<br/>
					Now how about you?<br/>
					<br/>Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue<br/>
					Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you<br/>
					<br/>Sweet home Alabama Oh sweet home baby<br/>
					Where the skies are so blue And the guv'nor's true<br/>
					Sweet Home Alabama Lordy Lord, I'm coming home to you<br/>
					Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer
