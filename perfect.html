					I found a love for me Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br/>
					Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br/>
					Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br/>
					<br/>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br/>
					Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time<br/>
					But darling, just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own<br/>
					And in your eyes you're holding mine<br/>
					<br/>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms<br/>
					Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song<br/>
					When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath<br/>
					But you heard it, Darling, you look perfect tonight<br/>
					<br/>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br/>
					She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br/>
					I found a love to carry more than just my secrets<br/>
					To carry love, to carry children of our own<br/>
					<br/>We are still kids but we're so in love Fighting against all odds<br/>
					I know we'll be alright this time<br/>
					Darling, just hold my hand Be my girl, I'll be your man<br/>
					I see my future in your eyes<br/>
					<br/>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms<br/>
					Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song<br/>
					When I saw you in that dress Looking so beautiful<br/>
					I don't deserve this Darling, you look perfect tonight<br/>
					<br/>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms<br/>
					Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song<br/>
					I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel in person<br/>
					And she looks perfect I don't deserve this You look perfect tonight
