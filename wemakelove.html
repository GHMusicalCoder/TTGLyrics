					There's a light In your eyes tonight,<br/>
					You know I'd know that look anywhere.<br/>
					You got plans And I'm one lucky man.<br/>
					Before we get so carried away<br/>
                    There's just something I've been wanting to say<br/>
					<br/>When we make love, It's more to me than just an affair,<br/>
					I want you to know how much I care.<br/>
					When we make love, Oh, it's such a precious time,<br/>
					We share our hearts, our souls and our minds. When we make love.<br/>
					<br/>Watching you, Make your little moves.<br/>
					I can tell it's gonna be a long night.<br/>
					All day long, We keep holdin' on.<br/>
					It couldn't be any better than this, I got it all at my finger tips.<br/>
					<br/>When we make love, Oh, it's more than just an affair,<br/>
					I want you to know how much I care.<br/>
					When we make love, Oh, it's such a precious time,<br/>
					We share our hearts, our souls and our minds.<br/>
					<br/>These moments These feelings Mmmmmm<br/>
					<br/>When we make love, It's more to me than just an affair.<br/>
					I want you to know how much I care.<br/>
					When we make love, Oh, it's such a precious time,<br/>
					We share our hearts, our souls and our minds.<br/>
					<br/>Now let's make love.
