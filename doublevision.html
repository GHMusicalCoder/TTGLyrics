					Feelin' down and dirty, feelin' kind of mean<br/>
					I've been from one to another extreme<br/>
					It's time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait<br/>
					I wanna stick around till I can't see straight<br/>
					<br/>Fill my eyes with that double vision<br/>
					No disguise for that double vision<br/>
					Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me<br/>
					My double vision gets the best of me<br/>
					<br/>Never do more than I, I really need<br/>
					My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead<br/>
					Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit<br/>
					I'll live all of my years in a single minute<br/>
					<br/>Fill my eyes with that double vision<br/>
					No disguise for that double vision<br/>
					Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me<br/>
					My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah<br/>
					<br/>Ooh, double vision, I need double vision<br/>
					It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head<br/>
					I get my double vision<br/>
					Oh, seeing double double<br/>
					Oh, I have double vision, yeah, I'm getting double vision
