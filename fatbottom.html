                    Oh you gonna take me home tonight<br/>
					Oh down beside that red fire light<br/>
					Oh you gonna let it all hang out<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round<br/>
					<br/>Hey I was just a skinny lad, Never knew no good from bad<br/>
					But I knew love before I left my nursery<br/>
					Left alone with big fat Fanny, She was such a naughty nanny<br/>
					Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me, Hey hey!<br/>
					<br/>I've been singing with my band, Across the water, across the land<br/>
					I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way (hey)<br/>
					But their beauty and their style, Went kind of smooth after a while<br/>
					Take me to them naughty ladies every time, C'mon!<br/>
					<br/>Oh, won't you take me home tonight?<br/>
					Oh, down beside your red fire light<br/>
					Oh, and you give it all you got<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round<br/>
					<br/>Hey, listen here<br/>
					Now I got mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones<br/>
					Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)<br/>
					Oh, but I still get my pleasure, Still get my greatest treasure<br/>
					Heap big woman you done made a big man of me (now get this)<br/>
					<br/>Oh (I know), you gonna take me home tonight (please)<br/>
					Oh, down beside that red fire light<br/>
					Oh, you gonna let it all hang out<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round (yeah)<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round<br/>
					<br/>Get on your bikes and ride<br/>
					Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, them fat-bottomed girls<br/>
					Fat-bottomed girls, yeah, yeah, yeah,<br/>
					All right, Ride 'em cowboy, Fat-bottomed girls<br/>
					Yes, yes, right.
