                    And I'm boilin' up inside Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time<br/>
                    <br/>Tie your Mother down Tie your Mother down<br/>
                    Lock your Daddy out of doors I don't need him nosing around<br/>
                    Tie your Mother down Tie your Mother down<br/>
                    Give me all your love tonight<br/>
                    <br/>You're such a dirty louse Go get outta my house<br/>
                    That's all I ever get from your<br/>
                    Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard<br/>
                    A single little civil word from those guys<br/>
                    But you know I don't give a light I'm gonna make out all right<br/>
                    I've got a sweetheart hand To put a stop to all that<br/>
                    Grousin' an' snipin'<br/>
                    <br/>Tie your Mother down Tie your Mother down<br/>
                    Take your little brother swimmin' With a brick (that's all right)<br/>
                    Tie your Mother down, Tie your Mother down<br/>
                    Or you ain't no friend of mine<br/>
                    <br/>Bad guy<br/>
                    <br/>OOh Your momma and your Daddy gonna Plague me til I die<br/>
                    Why can't they understand I'm just a Peace lovin' guy<br/>
                    <br/>Tie your Mother down Tie your Mother down<br/>
                    Get that big big big big big daddy outta the door<br/>
