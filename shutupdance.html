                    Oh don't you dare look back, Just keep your eyes on me.<br/>
                    I said, "You're holding back," She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"<br/>
                    This woman is my destiny She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,<br/>
                    Shut up and dance with me."<br/>
                    <br/>We were victims of the night, The chemical, physical, kryptonite<br/>
                    Helpless to the bass and the fading light<br/>
                    Oh, we were bound to get together, Bound to get together.<br/>
                    She took my arm, I don't know how it happened.<br/>
                    We took the floor and she said,<br/>
                    <br/>"Oh, don't you dare look back. Just keep your eyes on me."<br/>
                    I said, "You're holding back," She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"<br/>
                    This woman is my destiny She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,<br/>
                    Shut up and dance with me."<br/>
                    <br/>A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,<br/>
                    My discoth√®que, Juliet teenage dream.<br/>
                    I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.<br/>
                    I knew we were bound to be together, Bound to be together<br/>
                    <br/>She took my arm, I don't know how it happened.<br/>
                    We took the floor and she said,<br/>
                    <br/>"Oh, don't you dare look back. Just keep your eyes on me."<br/>
                    I said, "You're holding back," She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"<br/>
                    This woman is my destiny She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,<br/>
                    Shut up and dance with me."<br/>
                    Oh, come on girl!<br/>
                    <br/>Deep in her eyes, I think I see the future.<br/>
                    I realize this is my last chance.<br/>
                    She took my arm, I don't know how it happened.<br/>
                    We took the floor and she said,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    "Oh, don't you dare look back. Just keep your eyes on me."<br/>
                    I said, "You're holding back," She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"<br/>
                    This woman is my destiny She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,<br/>
                    Shut up and dance!"<br/>
                    "Don't you dare look back. Just keep your eyes on me."<br/>
                    I said, "You're holding back," She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"<br/>

                    <br/>Ooh-ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me<br/>
                    <br/>Ooh-ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me<br/>
