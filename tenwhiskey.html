                    <hr>
                    I used to spend my nights out in a barroom<br/>
					Liquor was the only love I've known<br/>
					But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom<br/>
					And brought me back from being too far gone<br/>
					<br/>You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br/>
					You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br/>
					You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br/>
					And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br/>
					<br/>I've looked for love in all the same old places<br/>
					Found the bottom of a bottle always dry<br/>
					But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it<br/>
					'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high<br/>
					<br/>You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br/>
					You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br/>
					You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br/>
					And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br/>
					<br/>You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br/>
					You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br/>
					You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br/>
					And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br/>
					<br/>You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
