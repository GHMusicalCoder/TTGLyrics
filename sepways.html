                    Here we stand Worlds apart Hearts broken in two, two, two<br/>
					Sleepless nights Losing ground I'm reaching for you, you, you<br/>
					<br/>Feelin' that it's gone Can't change your mind<br/>
					If we can't go on To survive the tide Love divides<br/>
					<br/>Someday love will find you Break those chains that bind you<br/>
					One night will remind you How we touched And went our separate ways<br/>
					If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you<br/>
					You know I still love you Though we touched And went our separate ways<br/>
					<br/>Troubled times Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain<br/>
					Distant eyes Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain<br/>
					<br/>If you must go I wish you love<br/>
					You'll never walk alone Take care, my love Miss you, love<br/>
					<br/>Someday love will find you Break those chains that bind you<br/>
					One night will remind you How we touched And went our separate ways<br/>
					If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you<br/>
					You know I still love you Though we touched And went our separate ways<br/>
					<br/>No<br/>
					<br/>Someday love will find you Break those chains that bind you<br/>
					One night will remind you<br/>
					If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you<br/>
					You know I still love you<br/>
					<br/>I still love you, girl I really love you, girl<br/>
					And if he ever hurts you True love won't desert you<br/>
					<br/>No<br/>
					no
