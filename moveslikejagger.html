					Oh..., Oh!<br/>
                    Just shoot for the stars If it feels right<br/>
                    And aim for my heart If you feel like<br/>
                    And take me away and make it OK I swear I'll behave<br/>
                    <br/>You wanted control So we waited<br/>
                    I put on a show Now I make it<br/>
                    You say I'm a kid My ego is big I don't give a shit<br/>
                    And it goes like this (Uh)<br/>
                    <br/>Take me by the tongue And I'll know you<br/>
                    Kiss me 'til you're drunk And I'll show you<br/>
                    All the moves like Jagger I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    I don't need to try to control you<br/>
                    Look into my eyes and I'll own you<br/>
                    With them moves like Jagger I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    <br/>Maybe it's hard When you feel like<br/>
                    you're broken and scarred Nothing feels right<br/>
                    But when you're with me I'll make you believe That I've got the key<br/>
                    Oh So get in the car We can ride it<br/>
                    Wherever you want Get inside it<br/>
                    And you want to steer But I'm shifting gears<br/>
                    I'll take it from here (Oh! Yeah yeah!)<br/>
                    And it goes like this (Uh)<br/>
                    <br/>Take me by the tongue And I'll know you (Uh)<br/>
                    Kiss me 'til you're drunk And I'll show you<br/>
                    All the moves like Jagger I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    I don't need to try to control you (Oh, yeah)<br/>
                    Look into my eyes and I'll own you<br/>
                    With them moves like Jagger I've got the moves like Jagger (Yeah yeah)<br/>
                    I've got the moves like Jagger<br/>
                    <br/>You wanna know how to make me smile<br/>
                    Take control, own me just for the night<br/>
                    And if I share my secret You're gonna have to keep it<br/>
                    Nobody else can see this<br/>
                    So watch and learn I won't show you twice<br/>
                    Head to toe, oooh baby rub me right<br/>
                    But if I share my secret You're gonna have to keep it<br/>
