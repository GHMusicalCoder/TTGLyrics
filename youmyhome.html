					When you look into my eyes and you see the crazy gypsy in my soul<br/>
                    It always comes as a surprise when I feel my withered roots begin to grow<br/>
                    Well I never had a place that I could call my very own<br/>
                    That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home<br/>
                    <br/>When you touch my weary head And you tell me everything will be all right<br/>
                    You say, "Use my body for your bed<br/>
                    And my love will keep you warm throughout the night"<br/>
                    Well I'll never be a stranger and I'll never be alone<br/>
                    Wherever we're together, that's my home<br/>
                    <br/>Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike<br/>
                    Indiana's early morning dew<br/>
                    High up in the hills of California Home is just another word for you<br/>
                    <br/>Well I never had a place that I could call my very own<br/>
                    That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home<br/>
                    <br/>If I travel all my life and I never get to stop and settle down<br/>
                    Long as I have you by my side There's a roof above and good walls all around<br/>
                    You're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome<br/>
                    I need you in my house 'cause you're my home<br/>
                    You're my home
