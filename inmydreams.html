                    Toss and turn all night in the sheets I can't sleep<br/>
					Night after night don't know what it means In my dreams<br/>
					What can I say or do You won't come back, we're through<br/>
					I've realized too late That, baby, your love has turned away<br/>
					<br/>In my dreams, it's still the same<br/>
					Your love is strong, it still remains<br/>
					In my dreams, you're still by me<br/>
					Just the way it used to be<br/>
					<br/>Calling your name, but you're turning away Please don't leave<br/>
					Running in circles, waiting to see you In my dreams<br/>
					What can I say or do You won't come back, we're through<br/>
					I've realized too late That, baby, your love has turned away<br/>
					<br/> In my dreams, it's still the same<br/>
					Your love is strong, it still remains<br/>
					In my dreams, you're still by me<br/>
					Just the way it used to be<br/>
					<br/>In my dreams, it's still the same<br/>
					Your love is strong, it still remains<br/>
					In my dreams, you're still by me<br/>
					Just the way it used to be<br/>
					<br/>In my dreams, it's still the same<br/>
					Your love is strong, it still remains<br/>
					In my dreams, you'll always be<br/>
					In my heart and in my dreams<br/>
					In my dreams, it's still the same<br/>
					In my dreams, you're still by me<br/>
					In my dreams, just the way it used to be<br/>
					In my dreams, what can I say<br/>
					In my dreams, You're still by me<br/>
					And in my dreams, You'll always be<br/>
					In my dreams, You'll always be<br/>
					In my dreams, your love is strong<br/>
					In my dreams, You're still the same<br/>
					In my dreams
