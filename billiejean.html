                    She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br/>
					I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one<br/>
					Who will dance on the floor in the round?"<br/>
					She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round<br/>
					<br/>She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene<br/>
					Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br/>
					Who will dance on the floor in the round<br/>
					<br/>People always told me, "Be careful of what you do.<br/>
					And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."<br/>
					And mother always told me, "A-be careful of who you love,<br/>
					And be careful of what you do 'Cause the lie becomes the truth."<br/>
					<br/>Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl<br/>
					who claims that I am the one but the kid is not my son<br/>
					She says I am the one But the kid is not my son<br/>
					<br/>For forty days and for forty nights Law was on her side<br/>
					But who can stand When she's in demand Her schemes and plans<br/>
					'Cause we danced on the floor in the round<br/>
					So take my strong advice Just remember to always think twice<br/>
					(Do think twice, do think twice.)<br/>
					<br/>She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three." Then she looked at me<br/>
					Then showed a photo of a baby cry His eyes looked like mine, oh, no<br/>
					Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby<br/>
					<br/>A-people always told me, "Be careful of what you do<br/>
					And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."<br/>
					A-but she came and stood right by me And just the smell of sweet perfume<br/>
					And this happened much too soon And she called me to her room<br/>
					<br/>Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl<br/>
					who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son<br/>
