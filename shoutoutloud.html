					Well, the night's begun and you want some fun<br/>
					Do you think you're gonna find it<br/>
					You got to treat yourself like number one<br/>
					Do you need to be reminded<br/>
					<br/>It doesn't matter what you do or say<br/>
					Just forget the things that you've been told<br/>
					We can't do it any other way<br/>
					Everybody's got to rock and roll, whoo, oh, oh<br/>
					<br/>Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					<br/>If you don't feel good, there's a way you could<br/>
					Don't sit there broken hearted<br/>
					Call all your friends in the neighborhood<br/>
					And get the party started<br/>
					<br/>Don't let 'em tell you that there's too much noise<br/>
					They're too old to really understand<br/>
					You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys<br/>
					'Cause it's time for you to take a stand, yeah, yeah<br/>
					<br/>Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					<br/><span class="chords">[Chords: Db Ab Eb Db Ab Bb]</span>
					<br/>Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					You've got to have a party<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Turn it up louder<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Everybody shout it now<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Oh yeah<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					Hear it gettin' louder<br/>
					Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud<br/>
					And everybody shout it now<br/>
					Shout it
